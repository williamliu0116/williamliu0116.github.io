	<p>Hi there! I'm William Liu, a highschool sophomore at Ruben S. Ayala. This year I am taking AP CSP, which is the reason that I made this website. My hobbies are watching youtube and playing video games. I came from Taiwan at the beginning of my freshman year. My favorite subject is Biology which i took last year. Even though it is just the second week of school I kind of wish that summer can come sooner.
